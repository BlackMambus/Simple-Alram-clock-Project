# Simple-Alram-clock-Project

This project is a simple digital alarm clock built using Python's tkinter library for the graphical interface and time for time tracking. The clock allows users to set an alarm by specifying a time in HH:MM:SS format. Once the alarm time is reached, the program plays an alarm sound using the playsound library and displays a pop-up notification to alert the user.

Features:
User-Friendly Interface – Built using tkinter for easy interaction.

Alarm Setting Functionality – Users can input a custom alarm time.

Real-Time Time Tracking – Continuously checks the system time to trigger the alarm.

Sound Notification – Plays an alarm sound when the set time is reached.

Threading Support – Uses threading to prevent UI freeze while checking time.

Technologies Used:
Python – The core programming language.

tkinter – GUI toolkit for creating a simple interface.

time – Handles time tracking.

playsound – Plays an alarm sound when triggered.

threading – Allows the alarm function to run in the background without disrupting the UI.
